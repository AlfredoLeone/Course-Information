###Student Learning Outcomes:

1. Top-Down Design - Construct a top-down design for the solution of a computer program.
2. Programming - Implement programs utilizing fundamental programming constructs (i.e., sequential, computational, logical and looping programming constructs).
3. Data Structures - Implement programs using common data structures including arrays, records, files, and binary trees.
4. Modularity - Implement modules utilizing functions, procedures and recursive use.
5. Validation - Validate a program's correctness and make necessary corrections.
6. Documentation - Document and prepare materials supporting how a program works

###Grading:

Grades for the current semester are available on Moodle 2. At the end of the semester, the total number of points awarded is added up and grades are given on the basis of the percentage of that total. The grade basis is:

####Grade
Minimum Percentage

|:--|:-:|--:|
|A+ | ≥ |97%|  
A  ≥ 91%  
A- ≥ 88%  
B+ ≥ 85%  
B  ≥ 81%  
B- ≥ 78%  
C+ ≥ 75%  
C  ≥ 69%  
D  ≥ 59%  
F  < 59%

####Note:

ALL WORK (EXCEPT THE FINAL) IS DUE BY THE SUNDAY FOLLOWING THE LAST DAY OF INSTRUCTION. NO EXCEPTIONS.

I use 91% rather than 92% so I can give a higher grade to those students who are close. This means that if you are at 90.99% you are not close to an "A".
This class is problem, exercise, and lab oriented. You must successfully complete all of the problems and exercises in order to get the maximum out of this class.
Exercises, quizzes, and labs will vary in what they are worth depending upon the level of difficulty.

Exercises, quizzes, and labs are turned in when they are submitted using Moodle. No credit will be given for any other method of submission unless explicitly requested to do so.
Assignments with due dates on the Sunday following the last day of instruction cannot be turned in late.

The midterm and the final exam will be given on the dates announced on the web pages.
Quizzes have a half an hour time limit and are for the express purpose of making sure that you are keeping up on your reading. Quizzes can be taken twice (with a half an hour between attempts) but are due on the time and date specified and cannot be completed late.

####Late Assignments:

To get the most out of the class all assignments should be turned in before the time shown for each individual assignment. Do not make assumptions about when items are due! However, some items are accepted late using the procedure detailed below.

Exercises  
	-  Can be turned in late.

In-Class Assignments  
	-  **Cannot** be turned in late.

Labs  
	-  Can be turned in late.

Midterm  
	-  **Cannot** be turned in late.

Final  
	-  **Cannot** be turned in late.

####Procedure for late assignments

You are assigned 10 points into your bank for late assignments at the beginning of the semester. Each point (out of 10 points) represents one day late on an assignment that can be turned in late. If you are late up to 24 hours you will have one point deducted from your bank. Up to 48 hours is 2 points, etc. Once you have exhausted all of your points you will receive no credit for late assignments. At the end of the semester, any remaining points in your bank will be doubled and added to your total score as extra credit.

###Accomodations

SBCC students with verified disabilities who are requesting academic accommodations should use the following procedure:

**Step 1:** Obtain documentation of your disability from a licensed professional. You may use the “Disability Verification Form” found at [www.sbcc.edu/dsps](http://www.sbcc.edu/dsps).

**Step 2:** Make an appointment to meet with a DSPS Specialist to review your documentation an**d discuss reasonable accommodations. To schedule a meeting, please call DSPS at (805) 730-4164.

**Step 3:** Bring your disability documentation to your DSPS appointment. The DSPS office is located in room 160 of the Student Services building.

**Step 4:** Each semester, reach written accommodation agreement with the DSPS Specialist and your instructor.

Please complete this process in a timely manner to allow adequate time to provide accommodation.
